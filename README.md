#  SkyLight Computer Vision

Copyright Â© 2022 Luke Van In

SkyLight is a testbed fo computer vision and AI for Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, 
Mac). It consists of computer vision algorithms, such as feature detection and 
optical flow estimation, using Metal compute shaders that run on GPU 
hardware, with the aim of providing interactive and real-time performance on 
consumer mobile hardware (e.g. iPhoneX / iPad). 

SkyLight is currently actively undergoing research and development. 
Collaboration is highly encouraged. Bug reports, feature requests, and pull 
requests are welcome.  

If you use this code in research or in a commercial or open source project, I 
would love to know. Please get in touch in GitHub or on
