#  SkyLight Computer Vision

SkyLight is a computer vision and AI testbed for Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, 
Mac). It provides performant computer vision algorithms such as feature 
detection and optical flow estimation. Metal compute shaders run on GPU 
hardware, with the aim of providing interactive and real-time performance on 
low end mobile hardware (e.g. iPhoneX / A11). 

SkyLight is currently still undergoing active development. Collaboration is 
highly encouraged. Please feel free to log issues or open a pull requests with
your contribution.
